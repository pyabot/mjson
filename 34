Rousseau’s observations of everyday life, however, are about precision rather than contemplation. With each minute that passes, they sharpen the view of the observant and expectant outsider for a moment of surprise – be it a jump into the water or a huge crucifix.","release_date":"2015-09-22"},{"vote_count":2,"id":268726,"video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"title":"To See the Sea","popularity":1.00319,"poster_path":"\/dfihSBUYTcYzjsT6m08ALVLc5o5.jpg","original_language":"cs","original_title":"Pojedeme k moři","genre_ids":[10751,35],"backdrop_path":"\/z8KPQSWlJsTc58dzRhBGvje5RPx.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"","release_date":"2014-04-10"},{"vote_count":2,"id":251707,"video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"title":"That Brief Summer","popularity":1.001795,"poster_path":"\/6ZoXIzePmYM69EZuiRI6fMUYouV.jpg","original_language":"da","original_title":"Den korte sommer","genre_ids":[18],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"","release_date":"1976-01-01"},{"vote_count":2,"id":447076,"video":false,"vote_average":7,"title":"Perdidos","popularity":1.00153,"poster_path":"\/s8DtnrGgm1dQxemo5HaHnJ2QGpk.jpg","original_language":"pt","original_title":"Perdidos","genre_ids":[12,18,53],"backdrop_path":"\/gHJk15euuuG0RyP8mmpq3W6Ee6U.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"New filme by portuguese director Sérgio Graciano.","release_date":"2017-05-18"},{"vote_count":0,"id":459139,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Robot & Scarecrow","popularity":1.001197,"poster_path":"\/fFH3WVKkoW4Df2qvbLGwxBBCxDW.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Robot & Scarecrow","genre_ids":[16,18,10749],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"A love story between a robot and a scarecrow who meet and fall for each other at a summer music festival.","release_date":"2017-06-04"},{"vote_count":0,"id":458296,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Lost in Lebanon","popularity":1.000837,"poster_path":null,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Lost in Lebanon","genre_ids":[99],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"As the Syrian war continues to leave entire generations without education, health care, or a state, Lost in Lebanon closely follows four Syrians during their relocation process. The resilience of this Syrian community, which currently makes up one fifth of the population in Lebanon, is astoundingly clear as its members work hard to collaborate, share resources, and advocate for themselves in a new land. With the Syrian conflict continuing to push across borders, lives are becoming increasingly desperate due to the devastating consequences of new visa laws that the Lebanese government has implemented, leaving families at risk of arrest, detention, and deportation. Despite these obstacles, the film encourages us to look beyond the staggering statistics of displaced refugees and focus on the individuals themselves.","release_date":"2017-05-19"},{"vote_count":0,"id":404209,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Bittersweet Days","popularity":1.000203,"poster_path":"\/cY2RHCKwIY82wJFoP7nr51auMIm.jpg","original_language":"es","original_title":"Bittersweet Days","genre_ids":[35,18],"backdrop_path":"\/ru7qzfUG46YtJz0AHhIqDpjxyNz.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"","release_date":"2017-06-02"},{"vote_count":0,"id":454636,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Spirit Game: Pride of a Nation","popularity":1.000203,"poster_path":"\/zvrp0LiUq5QTZplXUou5MXmtW2S.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Spirit Game: Pride of a Nation","genre_ids":[99],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"The documentary follows The Iroquois Nationals Lacrosse Team on the road as they compete in the 2015 World Box Lacrosse Championships.
