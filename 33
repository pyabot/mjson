With the Syrian conflict continuing to push across borders, lives are becoming increasingly desperate due to the devastating consequences of new visa laws that the Lebanese government has implemented, leaving families at risk of arrest, detention, and deportation. Despite these obstacles, the film encourages us to look beyond the staggering statistics of displaced refugees and focus on the individuals themselves.","release_date":"2017-05-19"},{"vote_count":0,"id":404209,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Bittersweet Days","popularity":1.000203,"poster_path":"\/cY2RHCKwIY82wJFoP7nr51auMIm.jpg","original_language":"es","original_title":"Bittersweet Days","genre_ids":[35,18],"backdrop_path":"\/ru7qzfUG46YtJz0AHhIqDpjxyNz.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"","release_date":"2017-06-02"},{"vote_count":0,"id":454636,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Spirit Game: Pride of a Nation","popularity":1.000203,"poster_path":"\/zvrp0LiUq5QTZplXUou5MXmtW2S.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Spirit Game: Pride of a Nation","genre_ids":[99],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"The documentary follows The Iroquois Nationals Lacrosse Team on the road as they compete in the 2015 World Box Lacrosse Championships.
